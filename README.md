## Insertion-Sort-Project
This project is the first project about Data Structures and Algorithm module by Patika.
It is desired to solve the problem with the Insertion Sort Method. Solution steps are available.  
### ***Insertion Sort***
Insertion sort is the simple sorting algorithm. To sort an array of size n in ascending order:
- You have to iterate over the array from arr[1] to arr[n].
- You should compare the current item (key) with the previous item.
- If the key item is smaller than the previous one, you should compare it with the previous items. You must move larger items one position up to make room for the replaced item.

## Merge-Sort-Project
This project is the second project about Data Structures and Algorithm module by Patika.
It is desired to solve the problem with the Merge Sort Method. Solution steps are available.  
### ***Merge Sort***  
Merge Sort is a **Divide and Conquer** algorithm.  
It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.


## Binary Search Tree Project
This project is the third project about Data Structures and Algorithm module by Patika.
It is desired to solve the problem with the Binary Sort Tree Method. Solution steps are available.  
### ***Binary Sort Tree***  
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
